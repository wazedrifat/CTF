Sometimes I am asked about the projects that I made for only myself. This is one of those projects. I need to calculate private key from a very big public key for CTF. So, I made script for myself to handle the calculation. Here I needed bigMod, Extended Euclidean, Mod Inverse, euler totient function & prime factorization. But prime factorization for 100+ digits needed complex algorithm implementation. This was made in a website(https://www.alpertron.com.ar/ECM.HTM?fbclid=IwAR0RF-VhPs1UZAYyFvMYQ5IDui-FrjQoNzPP190H_QwzpEvIJmU9lzMI5cs). So I made a python automation script to get the prime factorization from that website. and calculated the rest using above algorithms.
